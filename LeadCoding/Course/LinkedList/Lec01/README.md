## Uses of Linked List
- The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside any where in the memory and linked together to make a list. This achieves optimized utilization of space.
- List size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.
- Empty node can not be present in the linked list.
- We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.
- Example: 
    - Implemented in stack and queue, 
    - Image gallery, 
    - Music Gallery, 
    - Music Player, 
    - Browsers, 
    - Hashmaps, Hashset, Hash tables, Graphs,
    - Dynamic memory allocation
    - In undo functionality of softwares
